Our team decided that the best way to approach the Rubik's Cube problem was to take existing code and try to modify it to fit the problem rather than reinventing the wheel. Because of this, most of our time was spent figuring out what the old code does - rather than spending a short amount of time prototyping a Cube class and spending more time on the later questions, we wanted to spend more time upfront interfacing the cube so that the later problems would be easy.

We found an open source Rubik's Cube solver at http://pastebin.com/KwGMujyB and used Nitrous.IO to collaborate in real-time as opposed to git, which would involve pushing milestones. We documented the old code on paper and verbally.



Sam:
- Helped read and document the old code
- Discovered representation of face and cube objects so we could interface to it
- Wrote readme
- Organized tasks
- Helped with initializer code

Nishant:
- Helped read through existing code
- Wrote text parser based on team's discovery of cube representation
- Debugged code
- Worked to interface text representation with python representation

Sumeet:
- Idea of using existing code
- Helped read and document the old code
- Worked on in-depth analysis of classes/representations
- Implementing turning cube faces
